      them to vote on who they think the winner is and customize their dashboard through \
      favoriting. I also worked on developing a mobile app as a companion for the site. Dubb Club \

        and responses. The backend functionality also allowed us to filter out videos with \
        toxic and vulgar content. Additionally, the app used the same process to categorize \
        videos and display them to users having liked videos in similar categories. This \
        created a safe environment as well as a curated one.",
