### `View My Site`

I'm really proud of what I built and will hopefully continue to add onto it. Feel free to take a look at the finished product at [Aditya-Naik.com](http://aditya-naik.com/). Additionally, if you do decide to copy some (and especially all) of the code I wrote, I ask that you simply provide the necessary credit.
